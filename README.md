# HiPy: Python for Scientists
### An Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib

Welcome to HiPy! If you're reading this during one of our Hive events then we have a few simple rules:
  - Don't work in isolation. Find a partner or team and work together.
  - If you get stuck then turn to the nearest person and ask for help. They won't bite!
  - Have fun and lots of interesting conversations.
  
The objective of this notebook is to provide an introduction Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib. Be sure to checkout our other notebooks in the Python for Scientists Resources section at [hipy.uk](http://hipy.uk) You're not going to learn everything in the two or three hours that you're with us but hopefully we'll be able to showcase some really useful aspects of Python that will be of benefit to you and your research/studies.
